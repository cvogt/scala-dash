Script to generate Dash docsets for the documentation of many Scala libraries.

Why? Offline support, fast, unified search

Published as docset feeds here: http://cvogt.org/releases/docsets/

To run this yourself, you need httrack installed. I use version 3.48-21. You also need Dashing installed (https://github.com/technosophos/dashing)

How to contribute?
- improve existing docsets
- add docsets for more libraries
- clean up code
- improve quality of generated docsets
